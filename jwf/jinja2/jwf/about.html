  <p>Jan Weimer died on April 13, 2007 after a mostly confidential fifteen year
    battle with breast cancer. She left behind a legacy of creativity, devotion
    and selfless friendship. She mentored many women in their careers and supported
    many causes. As she saw her own end coming, she had a vision to help women
    who are suffering from cancer as she did. We had many conversations about
    our shared estate and vision. Jan wanted to &ldquo;beat the littlef---ers&rdquo; that
    were invading her body. She felt blessed that she could continue her career
    despite side effects of chemotherapy and afford a natural hair wig that kept
    her secret almost to the end.</p>
  <p>To keep faith with her vision, I have led a group of her friends in organizing
    a fund raising effort to endow a chair in breast oncology at Stanford Medical
    School, where we both graduated. Our friend and my medical school classmate,
    Ron Levy, a major researcher in the field of cancer biology and head of Stanford
    Oncology, is the perfect steward for the funds raised. Stanford has committed
    to honor Jan&rsquo;s wishes and fulfill her vision and I have committed our
    estate to the project.</p>
  <p>Please join me in contributing funds to the Jan Weimer Memorial Fund to
    endow a research program to support the professorial chair established in her name. </p>
  <p>Please dig deep into the pocket book and send donations to:</p>
  <blockquote>Jan Weimer Fund<br>
  c/o Dr. Sanford Weimer<br>
  517. E. Wilson, Ste. 105,<br>

    <p>The 941156365 is the Stanford tax ID number, which is to be used by those with charitable trusts or foundations that can only contribute to public charities. We would like to emphasize that if at all possible those with these charitable foundations make their checks payable directly to Stanford Univeristy, put Jan Weimer Fund in the memo section, but mail them to our Glendale office so we can, again, properly record, track and forward the funds to Stanford. If they have to be mailed directly to Stanford, we would like to emphasize to people to please notify us of their contribution so we can track it and assure its proper accounting in the Stanford system.</p>
